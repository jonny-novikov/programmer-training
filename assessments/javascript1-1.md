# JavaScript Assessment 1.1

## Foundational Concepts

- [ ] What are the differences between functional and object orientated programming? 
- [ ] Functional and object orientated. Which is better and why? 
- [ ] Explain what recursion is and how it works.
- [ ] You're creating a function. What is the thought process that you take in order to create it. Write a minimum of 200 words. 
- [ ] Explain the difference between mutable and immutable. Which is better and why?
- [ ] What situation would you build a function mutably? 
- [ ] Explain SPREAD and REST operators.
- [ ] Explain var, let and const and best practice with using each.
- [ ] Name 3 different ways that you could create a guard statement and why they would stop your function.


## Exercise Practice

### Build a Map function using ES6

How concise can you be? Flex those newly formed ES6 skills and show off just how tight your coding has become! 

Create a Map function that is: 

- [ ] A one line function and under 100 characters (Excludes calling your function - do that on another line)


### Building a swear bot

You've created your own version of Slack for coders called 'Hack'. People are using it and it's great! Yay, congrats :) But wait! Oh dear - your users are a bunch of foul mouthed sailors! This is supposed to be family friendly G rated. We better make a swear bot to keep everyone in check.

Create a recursive function that can: 

- [ ] Take an unspecified number of arguments
- [ ] Will take an array
- [ ] Has a store of naughty words to check against 
- [ ] Will return a an array with all of the naughty words removed 


### Build a palindrome checker

Oh no! Everything I can't tell my front from my back! Let's make life easier for people by creating a function  that checks whether a word is a palindrome or not. What is a palindrome? A word or phrase that is the same both backward and forward. For example:

- kayak
- stressed desserts
- Taco Cat
- Not now wonton.
- A Car, a man, a maraca.

Create a function that: 

- [ ] Takes a string
- [ ] Checks the string to see if it's a palindrome
- [ ] Returns true or false
- [ ] Should be able to take all of the palindromes above, exactly how they have been written, and return true for all of them
