# Functional programming

While a lot of this will be review, we need to go in depth on how these ideas are expressed in JavaScript. You will know this stuff inside-out and outside-in by the time we are finished.

## Paradigms

- [Imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) vs. [Declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)
- [Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) (FP)
- [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP)
- [Prototype-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming)

## Functional concepts
 
- Immutability
- Referential transparencey and the substitution principle
- Pure functions
- First class functions
- Higher order functions
- Currying and partial application
- Recursion and tail recursion
- Memoization
- Lexical closures
- Lazy evaluation
- Garbage collection
- Decomposition of complex tasks

## Functional tools

We'll be using [ramda](http://ramdajs.com/0.21.0/index.html) to practice creating our functions.

- compose
- concat
- contains
- curry
- drop
- filter
- find
- flatten
- head
- lens
- lift
- map
- memoize
- merge
- omit
- partial
- pick
- range
- reduce
- reject
- remove
- repeat
- reverse
- scan
- sort
- slice
- split
- tail
- take
- tap
- zip

## JavaScript

There is a great reference on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

- Variables and scope
- Variable hoisting
- var, const, and let
- Closures
- Deep freeze
- Named functions
- Anonymous functions
- Fat arrow functions
- Loops and conditionals
- The ternary operator
- [Operator precendence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)
- Types and dynamic typing
- Pass by reference/pass by value
- Infinity, NaN, undefined, and null
- Parsing and type checking
- Object
- Booleans and boolean algebra (AND, OR, etc.)
- Symbols
- Math
- Dates and times (an ugly mess&mdash;use moment.js)
- Regular expressions
- JSON
- Promises (callbacks)
- Control flow
- Errors and error handling
- Generator functions
- Export and import (modules)
- The `this` keyword
- The `new` keyword
- Unary operators and arithmetic operators
- Increment and decrement
- Equality operators
- Assignment operators
- Default parameters
- Rest parameters
- Spread operator
- Destructuring
- Linting [JavaScript](http://eslint.org/) and [JSON](http://jsonlint.com/)
