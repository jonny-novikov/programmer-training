# Scratch Made Functions

In this folder we will build our functions from scratch. This will teach us the underlying computer science concepts that we are using, give us continual practice in coding in ES6 and other best practices and help to understand how to approach problem solving. 

Tools we'll use for building functions from scratch: 

- [Ramda REPL](http://ramdajs.com/repl/) - The tool that we will use most often when building functions from scratch.
- [Ramda DOCS](http://ramdajs.com/docs/) - When creating our functions we'll use the Ramda docs to: 
    1 - Confirm what the function is, does, takes and returns.
    2 - Compare the function we created output against - does ours match Ramda's 
    3 - Use if we get lost. It will be the first port of call if we are confused before we look for other resources.
- [MDN Mozilla Developers Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - One of the best resources online for information about JavaScript.
- Ramda Make Short URL - Ramda give you the ability to save the current state of the code you are creating in the repl. Every time you create a function you will save the url AND the code in your file folder (right here!) so that we can:
    1 - Go straight back to a copy of the function in the repl if you haven't finished working on it.
    2 - Save a copy that others can access straight away.
