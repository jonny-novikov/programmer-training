# PaperHat Programmer Plan

## How to become a world-class programmer

- All our training will be designed and customized to your learning, with specific goals in mind. 
- our learning will be mostly be split into two different categories: 
    - Foundational knowledge - complemented by practical coding skills
    - Conceptual knowledge - that will give context

Some of the information that we are cover we won't become experts in but we will learn so that we can discuss try until you can talk knowledgeably about them and work with them if necessary. 
- Knowing where to look for more information so you can review the concepts as needed is key.

** These goals are: **

1 - Learn the most up to date tools, techniques and best practices available.
2 - Cement the computer science foundations that will help you to interpret and understand the wider context of programming as well as filling any knowledge gaps that there may be.
3 - Create a platform of skills, knowledge and products that will make us the most affective when applying for jobs.

## Steps to achieve our goals

1. Review: Begin a thorough review, discovering where the holes and weaknesses in your knowledge are.
2. Foundation building: Work on building your conceptual foundations while practicing using the most up to date JavaScript methods available. 
3. Portfolio building: Build up your portfolio with real world examples: During this time - if you can find a small contract to do, you will be able to practice, get real world experience and earn extra income.
4. Git / Work flow: What is work flow? What are the best practices for using git?
5. Hacking the interview game: Practice being able to answer the most typical technical interview questions.
