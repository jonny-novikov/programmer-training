## Steps

1. Begin a thorough review, discovering where the holes and weaknesses in your knowledge are.
2. Look for a sufficiently challenging contract that will pay well enough to support you while learning.
3. Use real-world tools and processes to complete the contract while learning.
4. Utilize the Munat Method throughout, learning the method as well as you go.
5. Learn the skills to get and keep a good job, or to be successful as a freelancer or running your own business.

Although I've provided these in an ordered list, they will actually need to be done *iteratively*, running through all five steps repeatedly, getting better at each as you go.

I'm guessing that you know a third of this pretty well, a third of it is a bit iffy and might need some clarification, and a third is completely new. More important than the learning, however, is the *integration* of these skills and the requisite knowledge so that you can actually do the work. Without the big picture and plenty of practice *doing the work*, you will struggle mightily. And painfully.

If you want to solidify and increase your skill set and to succeed as a developer&mdash;to avoid throwing all the hard work you've done over the past few months away&mdash;then you need to do something like this *right now*. In just a few months, you'll have forgotten almost everything and what you do remember will be mostly obsolete. You *must* finish the training they started and screwed up and then spend at least a solid year or two working full time as a developer, or you are *back to square one*. You're not getting any younger (and neither am I), so think hard about this plan of action. Opportunity, as they say, knocks but once.

I leave you with this immortal poem from *Spoon River Anthology* by Edgar Lee Masters. It is called *George Gray* and it is a dead man reflecting on his tombstone and his life.


I have studied many times<br>
The marble which was chiseled for me&ndash;<br>
A boat with a furled sail at rest in a harbor.<br>
In truth it pictures not my destination<br>
But my life.<br>
For love was offered me and I shrank from its disillusionment;<br>
Sorrow knocked at my door, but I was afraid;<br>
Ambition called to me, but I dreaded the chances.<br>
Yet all the while I hungered for meaning in my life.<br>
And now I know that we must lift the sail<br>
And catch the winds of destiny<br>
Wherever they drive the boat.<br>
To put meaning in oneâ€™s life may end in madness,<br>
But life without meaning is the torture<br>
Of restlessness and vague desire&ndash;<br>
It is a boat longing for the sea and yet afraid.
