# PaperHat Programmer Plan

## How to become a world-class programmer

- All our training will be designed and customized to your learning, with specific goals in mind. 
- Our learning will be mostly be split into two different categories: 
    - Foundational knowledge - complemented by practical coding skills.
    - Conceptual knowledge - that will give context and create understanding of the patterns that reoccur in programming.

Some of the information that we are cover we won't become experts in but we will learn so that we can discuss try until you can talk knowledgeably about them and work with them if necessary. 
- Knowing where to look for more information so you can review the concepts as needed is key.

**These goals are:**

1. Learn the most up to date tools, techniques and best practices available.
2. Cement the computer science foundations that will help you to interpret and understand the wider context of programming as well as filling any knowledge gaps that there may be.
3. Create a platform of skills, knowledge and products that will make us the most affective when applying for jobs.

## Steps to achieve our goals

1. Review: Begin a thorough review, discovering where the holes and weaknesses are your knowledge.
2. Foundation building: Work on building your conceptual foundations while practicing using the most up to date JavaScript methods available. 
3. Portfolio building: Build up your portfolio with real world examples: During this time - if you can find a small contract to do, you will be able to practice, get real world experience and earn extra income.
4. Git / Work flow: What is work flow? What are the best practices for using git?
5. Hacking the interview game: Practice being able to answer the most typical technical interview questions.  

## The areas we will cover

- [Accessibility & usability](./accessibility/)
- [Career development](./career/)
- [Design processes](./design/)
- [Functional programming](./functional/)
- [Internet & networks](./internet/)
- [Reactive programming](./reactive/)
- [Software development](./development/)
- [Tools](./tools/)
- [Work flow & work flow tools](./workflow/)

## Working Document

- This is a working document which means it will change as we work on each goal.
- We will add more resources as we need or find them.
- If you find something that fits with our learning add it to your branch and create a pull request to have it added to master. 

## What makes a great programmer? 

What makes a great programmer? The ability to *manage complexity*. Before we become amazing at doing that here are a few tips for when learning's a bit tough. 

1. You are going to over think absolutely everything. Understanding comes slowly - so don't be too hard on yourself.
2. It's easier then it seems. It will seem harder and more complicated first, you'll hurt getting up some learning curves but eventually you'll weed through the complexity to the simple parts that create that complicated mess.
3. Practice makes perfect. Practice creates second nature understanding. Practice, practice, practice!
4. Break all the things! You'll create a deeper understanding of how ad why things work the way they do. 
5. Don't over do it. At a certain point pushing yourself means creating bad habits and inefficient learning. Take breaks. Don't work more then 6 hours in one consectutive sitting. Go have fun too :) 

You're not stupid. You can do this. Go be amazing!
