We'll add more here as we go along. If we're going to get contracts, the first things we'll have to do are:

1. Choose a name and set up a company
2. Build a simple company website and get business cards printed
3. Set up pages on LinkedIn and Facebook
4. Maybe get a Twitter account for the company
5. Consider writing articles for Medium or other outlets teaching people how to do things (creates credibility)
6. Find contracts to bid on and bid on them
